            <h2>Why EVs May Be More Harmful than Hybrid ICE</h2>
            <p class="date">Published on: October 10, 2024</p>
            <p>Electric Vehicles (EVs) are often viewed as a greener alternative to traditional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. However, concerns are emerging about the environmental impact of battery production and disposal. Hybrid ICE vehicles, on the other hand, offer a balance by reducing emissions while avoiding the massive carbon footprint of battery manufacturing.
